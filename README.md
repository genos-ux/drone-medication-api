# üöÅ Drone Medication Delivery API

This project is a **Django REST Framework** backend for managing drones and their medications.  
It was built as part of an internship backend assessment, focusing on **API design**, **validation**, and **clean backend architecture**.

---

## üß≠ Overview

The system allows administrators to:

- Register new drones  
- Load drones with medications (only if battery > 25%)  
- Check which medications are loaded on a specific drone  
- View available drones for loading  
- Check a drone‚Äôs battery level  

### Validation Rules

- No drone exceeds its maximum weight limit (**500 g**)  
- Drones with less than **25% battery** cannot be loaded  
- Drone serial numbers must be unique  
- Each medication must include:
  - `name`
  - `weight`
  - `code`
  - (optional) `image`
