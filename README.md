# üöÅ Drone Medication Delivery API

This project is a **Django REST Framework** backend for managing drones and their medications.  
It was built as part of an internship backend assessment, focusing on API design, validation, and clean backend architecture.

---

## üß≠ Overview

The system allows administrators to:

- Register new drones  
- Load drones with medications (if battery > 25%)  
- Check which medications are loaded on a specific drone  
- View available drones for loading  
- Check a drone‚Äôs battery level  

It also includes validation logic to ensure that:
- No drone exceeds its weight limit (max 500 g)
- Drones with less than 25% battery cannot be loaded
- Drone serial numbers are unique
- Each medication has a name, weight, code, and optional image

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Framework:** Django 5 + Django REST Framework
- **Database:** SQLite (default)
- **Testing:** Pytest + DRF Test Client
- **Media Handling:** Django media upload (local)
